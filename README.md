- **Market Resolution**: The platform admin can resolve a prediction market by specifying the outcome (true or false).
- **Claiming Winnings**: Users can claim their winnings if their bet matches the resolved outcome of the prediction market.
- **Market Details**: Users can retrieve key information about a prediction market, such as its resolution status, pool balances, and the resolved outcome (if available).
- **Access Control**: The application includes robust access control mechanisms to ensure secure operations.
