## Project Description:

SuiStream is a decentralized subscription platform built on the Sui blockchain, allowing creators to offer paid subscriptions for their content or services. Subscribers can purchase these subscriptions and access the content for a specified duration.

## Key Features:

- Subscription Creators: Individuals or organizations can become subscription creators by creating a SubscriptionCreator object on the platform.
- Subscriptions: Creators can create and offer subscriptions, each with a name, description, price, duration, and content (represented as a vector of bytes).
- Subscription Purchase: Users can purchase subscriptions by sending the required payment in SUI coins to the creator.
- Access Control: Subscribers can access the subscription content as long as their subscription is active (before the expiration time).
- Events: The platform emits events for subscription creation and purchase, enabling transparency and tracking.

### This project provides a decentralized and transparent way for creators to offer paid subscriptions for their content or services, while giving subscribers control over their subscriptions and access to the content they've paid for.

### The unique aspects of this project include the ability for creators to offer time-limited subscriptions with custom content, and the use of the Sui blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions and access control.
